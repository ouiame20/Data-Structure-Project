# ðŸš€ Distinct Sum & Dot Product Algorithms

Welcome to the **Distinct Sum & Dot Product Algorithms** repository! This project contains two algorithmic solutions written in pseudo-code to solve fundamental problems using arrays and loops. Whether you're brushing up on algorithmic thinking or looking for structured solutions, you've come to the right place! ðŸŽ¯

## ðŸ“Œ Problem 1: Sum of Distinct Elements

### Description
Given two sets of numbers, find the sum of all **distinct** elementsâ€”i.e., numbers that appear in one set but not both.

### Example
**Input:**  
Set 1: `[3, 1, 7, 9]`  
Set 2: `[2, 4, 1, 9, 3]`  
**Output:** `13` (Distinct elements: `[7, 2, 4]`)

### Approach
- Loop through each set to find elements **not present** in the other set.
- Sum up those distinct elements.
- Print the result.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem 2: Dot Product & Orthogonality Check

### Description
- The **dot product** of two vectors is computed as:
  
  \[ \text{dot product} = v1_1 \times v2_1 + v1_2 \times v2_2 + ... + v1_n \times v2_n \]
  
- If the dot product equals `0`, the vectors are **orthogonal** (perpendicular).

### Example
**Input:**  
v1 = `[1, 2, 3]`  
v2 = `[-3, 0, 1]`  
**Output:** `Vectors are orthogonal` (Dot product = `0`)

### Approach
- Read vectors from input.
- Compute the dot product using a loop.
- Check if the result is `0` to determine orthogonality.
